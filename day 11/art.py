    			    🃏 Welcome to Blackjack! 🃏


	1️⃣ Goal: Beat the dealer with a hand value close to 21 without 
          going over. 🃏💥

	2️⃣ Initial Deal: You and the dealer get 2 cards each. 🂠🂠

	3️⃣ Card Values: Numbered cards = face value, face cards (J, Q, K) = 10, 
	    Ace (A) = 1 or 11. 🂻 🂭 🃎 🃑

	4️⃣ Blackjack: Ace + 10-value card = instant victory dance! 💃💰

	5️⃣ Hit or Stand: "Hit" for another card, "Stand" to hold your ground. 🤜🛑

	6️⃣ Bust: Go over 21 and watch your chips vanish. 😵💸

	7️⃣ Dealer's Turn: They keep drawing until they hit 17 or more.

	8️⃣ Dealer Bust: If the dealer exceeds 21, you're the champ! 🎉🏆

	9️⃣ Draw: Same value? It's a tie game. 😎🤝


	      🎰 Best of luck! May the cards be in your favor! 🍀
